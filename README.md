# badFruit
Express app that showcases fruit that has led a rotten live

## Purpose 
I'll just say it, I struggle with Express.  I fumble with it and it seems very counterintuitive to me.  That is the very reason I am building this app. So I can get some more experience with Express.  Ok, there is another motive at play here.  I truly wanted to showcase bad fruit, as in BAD fruit.  These images were produced with the help of Midjourney.  When I was first learning how to build CRUD apps I was taught to just pick a theme and then make an app based around it.  First we had fruits, we made an app that could create, read, update and update fruit in a data base. Vegetables, we created a vegetable CRUD app. Dogs, cats, musicians with slugs (long story).  

Now we have Bad Fruit
